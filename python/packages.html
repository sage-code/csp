<h1>Python Packages</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
  Python core packages are the modules that are included with the Python interpreter itself. They are designed to provide basic functionality that is needed for most Python programs. You can create your own packages or use packages created by other software developers.

<h2 id="use-package">Use a Package</h2>

<p>To use a core Python package, you first need to import it into your program. This can be done using the "import" statement. Once you have imported the package, you can use its functions and classes. For example, to calculate the square root of 2, you would use the following code:</p>

<h4>Example:</h4>

<pre><code class="language-python">
import math

print(math.sqrt(2))
</code></pre>

<h4>Output:</h4>

<pre><code class="language-output">
<p>1.4142135623730951.</p>
</code></pre>

<p>For more information on how to use a core Python package, you can refer to the Python Standard Library documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html.</p>

<h2 id="core-packages">Core Packages</h2>

<p>In table below, generated with Bard AI bot, we have listed all Python packages with description and link to original documentation. This list can be used to enhance your know-how. You will learn the features of each package. Get yoursef familiar with all the packages before starting a project.</p>

<h2 id="third-party">Third Party Packages</h2>

<p>Third-party Python packages are software libraries that are developed and maintained by external organizations or individuals. These packages can be used to extend the functionality of Python or to provide specialized functionality that is not included in the standard Python library.</p>

<p>Open source packages are free to use and modify, and they are often developed by a community of contributors. This makes them a valuable resource for Python developers, as they can be used to save time and effort by providing pre-written code for common tasks.</p>

<p>Here is a table of some of the most popular third-party open source Python packages:</p>

<h2 id="manager">Package manager</h2>

<p>A Python package manager is a tool that helps you install, manage, and update Python packages. Packages are collections of Python code that are designed to be reused. They can contain modules, scripts, documentation, and other files.</p>

<p>Some popular Python package managers include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pip</strong> is the most popular Python package manager. It is built into Python and can install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI).</li>
<li><strong>Conda</strong> is a cross-platform package manager that can install packages from PyPI and other sources. It is often used for scientific computing.</li>
<li><strong>Poetry</strong> is a newer package manager that is designed to make it easy to manage Python dependencies. It can create virtual environments and install packages from PyPI and other sources.</li>
</ul>

<p>Package managers are essential for managing Python dependencies. Dependencies are other Python packages that your code needs to run. Without a package manager, you would have to manually download and install each dependency, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.</p>

<p>Package managers also make it easy to update your dependencies. This is important for security and bug fixes.</p>

<h2>Benefits of using a Python package manager</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of installation</strong>: Package managers make it easy to install packages with a single command.</li>
<li><strong>Dependency management</strong>: Package managers can help you to manage the dependencies of your projects. This can help to prevent conflicts between packages.</li>
<li><strong>Version control</strong>: Package managers can help you to track the versions of the packages that you are using. This can be helpful for debugging and troubleshooting.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Package managers can help to ensure that you are using the latest, most secure versions of the packages that you are using.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<p>If you are a Python developer, I recommend using a package manager to manage your dependencies. It will make your life easier and help you to write more reliable code.</p>

<p>If you are new to Python, I recommend starting with Pip. It is the most popular Python package manager and it is built into Python. Once you are familiar with Pip, you can explore other package managers, such as Conda and Poetry.</p>


<h2 id="create">Create a package</h2>

<p>To create a package in Python, you first need to create a directory for the package. This directory should contain an "__init__.py" file. The "__init__.py" file is a special file in Python that is used to initialize a package. It is required for any directory that you want to be treated as a Python package.</p>

</p>The __init__.py file can be empty, or it can contain code that is executed when the package is imported. This code can be used to initialize variables, import modules, or define functions.</p>

<p>Once you have created the directory and the "__init__.py" file, you can start adding modules to the package. Modules are Python files that contain code. To add a module to a package, simply create a file in the package directory with the name of the module.</p>

<h4>Steps:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Create a new directory for your package.</li>
<li>Create a file named "__init__.py" in the new directory.</li>
<li>Add your Python modules to the package directory.</li>
<li>Create a "setup.py" file in the package directory.</li>
<li>Install the package using the "pip" command.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is an example of how to create a package named "mypackage":</p>

<pre><code class="language-command">
mkdir mypackage
cd mypackage
touch __init__.py
</code></pre>

<p>The package file name mypackage.py</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
# __init__.py

def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
</code></pre>

<p>Create setup.py file. This is a Python script that is used to install and distribute Python packages. It contains information about the package, such as its name, version, and dependencies. It also contains instructions on how to install the package.</p>

<h4>Example:</h4>

<p>This setup.py file would install a Python package named mypackage that depends on the numpy and pandas packages.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name='mypackage',
    version='1.0',
    packages=['mypackage'],
    install_requires=['numpy', 'pandas'],
)
</code></pre>

<p>Installing the package:</p>

<pre><code class="language-command">
pip install --user mypackage
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have installed the package, you can import it into your Python programs. For example, the following code will print "Hello, world!" to the console:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
import mypackage

mypackage.hello_world()
</code></pre>


<p>The folder structure for the "mypackage" package would look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-command">
mypackage/
├── __init__.py
└── hello_world.py
</code></pre>
