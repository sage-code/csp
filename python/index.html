<h2>Python Tutorial</h2>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">Python is a high-level dynamic computer language. At this time is the most popular programming language according to <em>Tiobe Index</em>.  Python was written by <em>Guido van Rossum</em> as a system scripting language. Many universities are using Python to teach programming concepts of Computer Science.
</div>


<h2>Video Lecture</h2>

<p>Next video lecture is 2h long. It was recorded on Twitch in 2022. If you do not have the bandwidth for videos, or if you already know basic Python you can skip it. But if you watch it, you can post a comment and click the like button. This will help others interested in programming to find it and learn about us.

<h2>Course Scope</h2>

<div>
This tutorial is for very beginners. We have presented the language features in logical order with short examples and notes. We will improve this course using AI. The course will grow from beginner to intermediate level. Python is good entry level language. We will cover fundamental concepts of programming usin Python.
</div>

<h2><a id="py-index"></a>Curriculum</h2>

<p>This tutorial is organized like a book. At the end of each page there is a link for the next page. Every page has the <em>index</em> link on top right corner, that will bring you back here. If you wish to go back to a previous chapter, use the browser back button or the index below. If you are first time here, skip the index and read on the entire page. You will use the index later.

<h2>Python Issues:</h2>

<div class="alert alert-warning shadow-sm">Python is a great language if you use it for the right project. It is a productive language, but you should be aware of several limitations before choosing to use Python. There are other languages much better alternatives to Python that we recommand for beginners.</div>

<ul>
<li>Python is slow compared with other languages,</li>
<li>Python is vulnerable to tab and space indention issues,</li>
<li>Not having static types makes the language vulnerable to bugs,</li>
<li>The lack of a switch statement is a common complaint,</li>
<li>It lack tail-call recursion optimization,</li>
<li>Implementation of OOP is ugly compared to Java OOP,</li>
<li>Scoping using "global" and "nonlocal" is difficult to grasp,</li>
<li>Error messages are sometimes difficult to grasp: "Syntax error",</li>
<li>Python's multi-threading code is not very efficient.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why is Python slow?</h2>

<p>Python was designed to be "user friendly" that is why it is a <em>dynamic typed language</em> and not a <em>static typed language.</em> In dynamic languages you can change value and value type for a variable during runtime. This means there is no code optimization and there must be a garbage collector somewhere that slows down complex processes.</p>

<p>Another problem Python has is the GIL (global interpreter lock) this is hard to explain but it makes multi-core/parallel applications work slow. Actually this problem is resolved still for some reasons python multitasking is sluggish.</p>

<p>Butâ€¦ this it also depend on algorithms you are using. How much data you store in memory and how this data is organized. Python do not have Arrays like C, C++ and Java. Array require fix data length. In Python a collection can hold any kind of data: Numeric, String even other collections. So you can have a list of lists or a dictionary of lists. This is why Python is so slow. It uses dynamic lists.</p>

<h2>Python examples</h2>

<p>We have set-up several code snippets that you can clone from GitHub, investigate and modify. We have used these examples during the course. You can use replit or jupiter notebook, to create and run code on-line. Feel free to explore:

<h2>Other Resources</h2>
<p>Making a large project in Python require practice. Professional developers work locally on desktop computers and laptops. You can setup Python interpreter on your computer. Also there is a nice IDE available called IDLE. To make advanced projects in Python I recommend PyCharm IDE editor that has a community edition.</p>
