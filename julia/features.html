<h1>Julia Features</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm"> We believe that Julia has a great potential to become the most popular programming language. But what makes Julia a good candidate for higher popularity? It looks better than Python, feels better than Lisp, runs fast like Fortran. In this article we try to enumerate the most significant features that are implemented in Julia. </div>

<p>Julia implements LLVM-based just-in-time (JIT) compiler. Combined with the languageâ€™s design allow it to approach and often match the performance of C. That means we have a dynamic language, that uses native computer types to create a fast and optimized program for different platforms. Brilliant !!!</p>

<h2>Multiple dispatch</h2>
  
<p>Dispatch technique is the capability of a language to allow creation of polymorphic functions or methods. This is a function that can act on different argument types. In Julia we can create multiple versions of the same function for each argument type or combination of types. These sub-functions are called methods.</p>
<p>A function can have parameters with no type. In this case a dispatch is not possible and the arguments will have type "Any". The function has only one method. To make dispatch possible we must use a type annotation for one or more arguments using two column symbol "::" that is  named "is an instance of type &hellip;".</p>
<p>In multiple dispatch we use all parameters to identify a method. In Object Oriented programming single dispatch is used. Only one parameter is used to identify a method. The methods are attached to the first argument that is the type. In Java this parameter is invisible (default) and is the current object "this". In python this parameter is called "self". In Julia we do not have a similar default parameter.</p>
<p>Before we can use multiple dispatch we have to understand the types. Once we define types we can create multiple methods for these types. Therefore in Julia types are the corner stone of Julia language. Is the foundation Julia  philosophy.</p>

<h2>Companies using Julia</h2>

<p>Julia is a high-performance programming language for scientific and numerical computing. It is used by a wide range of companies, including:</p>
<ul class="list-group">
