<h2>C Pointers</h2>


<p>C programming language is famous for its ability to access memory directly by address. For this C has a special data types named pointers. We already mentioned pointers before, in the article about functions. Next you will learn a bit more about this concept.</p>

<h2>Pointer Variables</h2>

<p>You define a pointer variables using prefix "*" in front of variable name. A pointer can be initialized with value NULL. This is a constant that is actually = 0. It represents the zero memory location of a computer that is hardware protected and you can not read value or write value on this location.</p>

<h4>Example:</h4>
<pre><code class="language-c line-numbers">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main () {
    int *p = NULL;
    printf("The value of p is : %x\n", p);
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

<h2>Variable Address</h2>

<p>Address of a variable is extracted with symbol "&amp;" and it can be assigned to a pointer. This is the most common way to initialize a pointer. Once you know the location of a variable you can read or write its content using the pointer instead of variable name.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c line-numbers">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main () {
    int  d = 17;
    int  m = 11'
    int  y = 2020;
    int *p = &amp;y; // a pointer to integer
    printf("Value of p: %0X\n", p ); //a hexadecimal address
    printf("Value of *p: %d\n", *p ); //expected value 2020
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

<p><b>Output:</b></p>
<pre><code class="languace-output">Value of p: AF04
Value of *p: 2020
</code></pre>

<h2>Pointer Arithmetic</h2>

<p>Sounds exotic but is not hard at all. There are two ways to use a pointer after it is defined. First way to use it as value (with prefix *). Second is to use it as address (without the prefix). Since a pointer is a number it can be printed and you can perform arithmetic operations with it.</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<pre><code class="language-c line-numbers">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main () {
    int v = 5; // an integer variable
    int *p = &amp;v; // a pointer to integer variable
    //initial value
    printf("p = %0X\n", p );
    p = p + 1; //increment
    printf("p = %0X\n", p );
    p = p - 1; //decrement
    printf("p = %0X\n", p );
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

<p><b>Output:</b></p>
<pre><code class="languace-output">p = 384042E4
p = 384042E8
p = 384042E4</code></pre>

<p>Take a look at last digit of p. It is 4 then it is 8 then is back 4. That means we have changed the address where pointer p is pointing. We have incremented pointer with one, but we have got 4 numbers up. That is pointer arithmetic is "smart". It will give you next address for "int" type. Since my machine is on 32 bit, int occupy 4 bytes. So the increment it will sow me position for the next memory location after my integer.</p>

<h2>Increment &amp; Decrement</h2>

<p>There are two specific operators to C:</p>
<ul>
<li>increment operator:&nbsp;"++"</li>
<li>decrements operator&nbsp;"--"</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use these two operators to perform increments and decrements of pointers. They will be type dependent for pointers. It will increment/decrements an address with the size of data type. If an address point to 4 bytes, the increment will be size of data type divided by 4.</p>

<h2>Array Traversal</h2>

<p>Arrays are defined in C as read only pointers to first element of array. So we can assign this pointer to another&nbsp;<em>control pointer</em>&nbsp;that is not read only. By using pointer arithmetic we can change&nbsp;<em>control pointer&nbsp;</em>to visit all elements of the array.</p>

<h4>Example:</h4>
<pre><code class="language-c line-numbers">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main () {
    //define a vector of 10 elements
    int v[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100};
    int i; //control variable
    int *p; //temporary pointer
    p = v; // same as &amp;v
    printf("Address of v: %X\n", v ); // v is a read only pointer
    printf("Address of v: %X\n",&amp;v ); // pointing to first element
    printf("Content of v: %d\n",*v ); // expect: 10 this is first element
    /* array traversal using pointer arithmetic */
    for ( i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++, p++) {
        printf("v[%d] = %d\n", i, *p);
    }
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

<h4>Notes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>In previous example we initialize the array with elements using a literal;</li>
<li>The number of elements is automatically computed by C but we know is 10;</li>
<li>In for loop we use two increments: i++ and p++ separated by comma.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Comparing Pointers</h2>

<p>Since the pointers are&nbsp;<em>unsigned integer</em>&nbsp;numbers, you can compare two pointers using relation operators. For array traversal you can detect if one element is precedent, current or next using &lt; , = , &gt; like in example below.&nbsp;</p>
<pre><code class="language-c line-numbers">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main () {
    //define a vector of 10 elements
    int v[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100};
    //temporary pointer
    int *p;
    /* array traversal using pointer arithmetic */
    for ( p = &amp;v[0]; p &lt;= &amp;v[9]; p++) {
        printf("%d,", *p);
    }
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

<h2>Array of Pointers</h2>

<p>This is a strange thing. You can have a collection of pointers. These pointers can point to first element into another collection. The most common array of pointers is *char[]. It represents actually and array of strings, like in the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c line-numbers">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main () {
    char *capitals[] = {
        "Washington",
        "London",
        "Bucharest",
        "Moscow",
        "New Delhi"
    };
    int i = 0;
    for ( i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
        printf("capitals[%d] = %s\n", i, capitals[i] );
    }
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>Now you know almost everything about pointers. So we can continue with some juicy stuff:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Pointer as result</h2>

<p>You can use a pointer as a result of a function. Without pointers you can not return more than one single result, but using a pointer you can return a structure or array. There is a catch, the pointer or the structure must be allocated on the heap. A local array that is not dynamic allocated is on the stack and can not be returned as a result.</p>
<p><b>Rules:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Function name must have a pointer prefix: "*",</li>
<li>The variable you are going to return must be allocated on the heap.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<pre><code class="language-c line-numbers">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int *vector(int n)
{
    /* allocate memory on the heap */
    int *a = calloc(n, sizeof(int));
    if ( a != NULL ) {
        for( size_t i=0; i&lt;n; i++ ) {
            a[i] = i + 1;
        }
    }
    return a;
}
int main () {
    int *v, i, x = 10;
    /* generate a vector with x number of elements */
    v = vector(x);
    /* array traversal using pointer arithmetic */
    for (i = 0; i &lt; x; i++) {
        printf("%d,", *v);
        v++;
    }
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

<h2>Pointer to Struct</h2>

<p>Pointers can be used to refer to a&nbsp;struct&nbsp;by its address. This is particularly useful for passing structs to a function by reference or to refer to another instance of the&nbsp;struct&nbsp;type as a field.</p>
<p>The pointer value can be refereed just like any other pointer, using star operator: "*". There is also a specific operator "-&gt;" which is referring to the value of a member of the struct.</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<pre><code class="language-c line-numbers">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
/* declare a struct named point */
struct point {
    int x;
    int y;
};
int main() {
    struct point test = { 3, 7 }; //instance of point
    struct point *p = &amp;test; //reference to struct instance
    // Using "*" to de-reference struct members
    printf("p.x = %d\n", (*p).x );
    printf("p.y = %d\n", (*p).y );
    (*p).x = 2; // alter first member of the struct
    (*p).y = 4; // alter second member of the struct
    // Using "-&gt;" to de-reference struct members
    printf("p.x = %d\n", p-&gt;x);
    printf("p.y = %d\n", p-&gt;y);
} </code></pre>
