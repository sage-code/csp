<h1>CS Programming</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
The Sage Code Programming course is a comprehensive and well-organized introduction to programming. It covers a wide range of topics, from basic syntax to advanced concepts like object-oriented programming. The course is taught by experienced instructors who are passionate about teaching.</div>

<h2>Audience</h2>

<p>Optimum age for learning programming is between age of 12 to 35. If you are younger or older you should do something else. Our courses are beginner friendly but you will have an advantage if you are a freelancer, student, or have a job in IT. If you transition to IT from other domain, you shold take Software Engineering class first.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>Sage-Code Programming coursees can help you learn the skills you need to become an elite programmer. The course covers all of the essential topics, and it provides you with the opportunity to practice your skills in a variety of projects. There are many benefits to learning several programming languages:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Increased problem-solving skills:</strong> Learning multiple programming languages can help you develop your problem-solving skills. This is because each language has its own strengths and weaknesses, and by learning multiple languages, you can learn how to use the right tool for the job.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved versatility:</strong> Learning multiple programming languages can make you a more versatile developer. This means that you will be able to work on a wider range of projects and be more adaptable to change.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced career prospects:</strong> Learning multiple programming languages can make you more marketable to employers. This is because employers are always looking for developers who are proficient in multiple languages.</li>
</ul>

<p>As ChatGPT continues to develop, it will become increasingly capable of performing tasks that are currently done by human programmers. Learning multiple programming languages will help you avoid becoming obsolete. Elite programmers will still be needed to design and implement new software applications, and to solve complex problems that ChatGPT cannot.</p>

<h2>Curriculum</h2>

<p>Our course contain tutorials for 16 programing languages ordered by complexity. We advice for beginners to start with one of the simplest languages. More advanced developers, of course can chose whatever language preffer. Selecting your first programming language is a difficult task. Read the blog articles below, to help you decide. Enjoy reading!</p>
