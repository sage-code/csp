<h1>Dart Language</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
Dart is designed for client development such as web and mobile apps. It can also be used to build server and desktop applications. It is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax. It can compile to either machine code or JavaScript, and supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics and type inference.
</div>

  <h2>Dart History</h2>

<p>Dart was first announced in October 2011, and was released in beta in May 2013. The first stable release was in December 2013. Dart is an open source project, and is available under the BSD license.</p>


<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Dart was designed to be a modern, object-oriented language that is easy to learn and use. It is designed to be fast and efficient, and to support a wide range of platforms. Dart is also designed to be extensible, and to allow developers to create their own libraries and frameworks.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Syntactically similar to C-style languages</li>
  <li>Optional typing</li>
  <li>Garbage collection</li>
  <li>Cross-platform support</li>
  <li>Libraries and packages</li>
</ul>

<h2>Strengths</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fast development</li>
  <li>Strong typing</li>
  <li>Cross-platform support</li>
  <li>Good tooling</li>
</ul>

<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Smaller community</li>
  <li>Limited libraries</li>
  <li>Slow adoption</li>
  <li>Not widely used for enterprise applications</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ussage</h2>

<p>Dart is not yet popular, however it's popularity grows. It is an original very well received by an elite group of developers. Mostly used for it's ability to run on desktop and back-end. You need a single language to create complex n-tire applications.</p>

<h2>Dart vs Java</h2>

<p>We have chose to compare Dart with Java. We already know Java is the preferred developement platform for Android. Dart was designed to replace Java and has failed so far. However, Java is loosing developers because of Dart and Kotlin that are less rigit and multi-platform.</p>

<h3>Feature Comparison</h3>

<p>Comparison between Java and Dart features:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Syntax:</b> Both languages have syntax that is similar to C-style syntax, but Dart's syntax is considered to be easier to read and write. For example, Dart uses curly braces to declare blocks of code instead of the semicolon that Java uses.</li>
  <li><b>Type System:</b> Both languages support static typing, but Dart also supports dynamic typing. This allows developers to write code more easily and flexibly, and it can make development faster.</li>
  <li><b>Garbage Collection:</b> Both languages have garbage collection, which means that they automatically manage memory allocation and deallocation. However, Dart's garbage collection is more efficient and predictable than Java's, resulting in faster and smoother performance.</li>
  <li><b>Framework Support:</b> Both languages have a wide range of frameworks and libraries available, but Dart has a more modern and easier-to-use framework called Flutter, which is used for building mobile, web, and desktop applications. Additionally, Dart can be compiled to JavaScript, allowing developers to use it as a scripting language on the web.</li>
  <li><b>Development Tools:</b> Both languages have robust development tools, but Dart has a more advanced toolset that includes Dart DevTools, a suite of performance analysis tools, and Flutter's hot reload feature, which allows developers to see their changes in real-time.</li>
  <li><b>Asynchronous Programming:</b> Both languages have support for asynchronous programming, but Dart's version is more intuitive and simpler to use, offering developers better control and more flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dart Advantages over Java:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Simple and predictable syntax</li>
  <li>Better garbage collection resulting in faster and smoother performance</li>
  <li>Modern and easier-to-use framework called Flutter</li>
  <li>More advanced development tools including Dart DevTools and Flutter's hot reload feature</li>
  <li>More intuitive and flexible approach to asynchronous programming</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it's also worth noting that Java is a mature and battle-tested language with a larger and more established community and ecosystem, making it a great choice for certain types of projects. Ultimately, the choice of language depends on the specific needs of the project and the preferences and skillset of the developers involved.</p>

<h3>Performance Comparison</h3>

<p>In general, Java is known for its mature and robust performance, whereas Dart is a newer language known for its fast startup times and efficient garbage collection. Dart is very good for small and fast compiled applications while Java is good for enterprise applications.</p>

<p>Note: In table above, we can see Dart has good performance, very close to Java performance. This is impressive result. We know Java is much faster than Python and Ruby. So Dart is a significant competitor.</p>
