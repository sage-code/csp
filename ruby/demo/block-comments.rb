=begin
This demo does absolutely nothing.
In Ruby the null statement is nil
=end

# define a subroutine that does nothing
def pass
  nil # nothing expression
end

pass # call subroutine pass one time

=begin
Also the simple semicolumn ';'
does absolutely nothing 
=end

;;;  # call null statement 3 times
