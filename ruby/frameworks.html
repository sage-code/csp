<h1>Ruby Frameworks</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
Ruby is a scripting language most used for internet websites. To enhance Ruby you need a web framework. Ruby is not so popular like JavaScript because it can't run in the browser. However Ruby can be combined with JavaScript using Ruby web frameworks.
</div>

<h2>What is Ruby on Rails?</h2>

<p>Ruby on Rails, or simply Rails, is a popular open-source web framework written in the Ruby programming language. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and provides a set of conventions for rapid application development.</p>

<p>Some of the key features of Ruby on Rails include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Convention over Configuration: Rails has a strong emphasis on convention over configuration, which means that developers can focus on writing application code instead of configuring the framework.</li>
  <li>Active Record: Rails provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) library called Active Record, which simplifies database operations by mapping database tables to Ruby classes.</li>
  <li>Action Pack: Rails provides a set of tools for handling web requests and responses, including a router, a controller layer, and a view layer.</li>
  <li>Scaffolding: Rails provides a tool called scaffolding, which generates a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for a given database table.</li>
  <li>Gems: Rails has a rich ecosystem of community-contributed libraries called gems, which can be easily added to a project to provide additional functionality.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ruby on Rails is widely used in industry and has been used to build many popular web applications, including GitHub, Airbnb, Shopify, and Basecamp.</p>

<h2>Reactive Frameworks</h2>

<p>Ruby on Rails is not a reactive framework by default. However, there are a number of reactive extensions that can be used with Rails, such as StimulusReflex and Hotwire. These extensions allow you to build web applications that are more responsive, resilient, and elastic.</p>
