<h2>What is Ruby?</h2>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
Ruby is a dynamic, interpreted, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990Ë¢ by <em>Yukihiro Matz Matsumoto</em> from Japan. According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.

<h2>Video Lecture</h2>

<p>If you have the bandwidth, you can watch the next video to learn Ruby language. 
This film is 55 min long, it has few ads before starts but is very informative for beginners. 
It was filmed by Derek Banas in Feb 2015. Derek do not work for Sage-Code.
Just that I was learning from this video and I liked it. Maybe you will like it to.

<h2><a id="ruby-index"></a>Learning Ruby</h2>

<p>Next tutorial will describe Ruby language in details.
If you read one page every day you will finish learning in one week.
We organize pages in logical order but sometimes you need to read them twice.
For each page you should spend about 1 hour.
Don't forget to take a break after reading each page.
You can use the next index to visit each chapter.
If you are first time here, ignore the index for now and continue reading.</p>

<h2>Ruby vs Python</h2>

<p>Ruby is a general purpose scripting language and has very good drivers for databases. Therefore Ruby is as good as Python for creation of test automation scripts, data pipelines and server side scripts. It has a different philosophy than Python that make Ruby programmers slightly more productive. Ruby is also about 30% faster than Python.</p>
