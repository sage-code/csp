<h2>Nim Functions</h2>


<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
In Nim, a function is a named block of code that can be called multiple times. Functions can take parameters, and they can return values. Functions are a very important part of programming, and they can be used to solve a variety of problems.
</div>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>

<p>Functions in Nim are used for the same reasons they are used in other programming languages: to encapsulate code, to reuse code, and to improve code modularity and maintainability.</p>
<p>Here are some specific use cases for functions in Nim:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Encapsulation: Functions can be used to encapsulate code that performs a specific task. This makes the code easier to understand and to maintain.</li>
  <li>Reusability: Functions can be reused multiple times, which can save time and effort.</li>
  <li>Modularity: Functions can be used to break up large pieces of code into smaller, more manageable pieces. This makes the code easier to read and to understand.</li>
  <li>Maintainability: Functions are easier to maintain than repetitive blocks of code, as they are more modular and easier to understand.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>

<p>There are several advantages to creating a function versus repetitive blocks of code:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reusability</li>
  <li>Maintainability</li>
  <li>Efficiency</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>

<p>However, there are also some disadvantages to creating functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overhead</li>
  <li>Complexity</li>
  <li>Testing</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Notes: </b>Overall, the decision of whether to create a function or use repetitive blocks of code is a trade-off between the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>A function is a named block of code that can return a value, while a procedure is a named block of code that does not return a value.</p>

<p>Functions can be used to encapsulate code that performs a specific task, while procedures can be used to break up large pieces of code into smaller, more manageable pieces.</p>

<p>Functions can also be used to return values, while procedures do not return values.</p>

<p>In Nim, the keyword "proc" is used to declare a procedure, while the keyword "func" is used to declare a function.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a function in Nim:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nim line-numbers">
func add(x: int, y: int): int =
  return x + y
</pre></code>

<p>This function takes two integers as input and returns their sum.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a procedure in Nim:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nim line-numbers">
proc print(message: string): unit =
  echo message
</pre></code>

<p>This procedure takes a string as input and prints it to the console.</p>

<p>In Nim, functions and procedures can be called in the same way. To call a function, simply specify the name of the function followed by the arguments that you want to pass to it. To call a procedure, simply specify the name of the procedure followed by the arguments that you want to pass to it.</p>

<p>For example, the following code calls the "add" function with the arguments 5 and 10:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nim">
result = add(5, 10)
</pre></code>

<p>The following code calls the "print" procedure with the argument "Hello, world!"</p>

<pre><code class="language-nim">
print("Hello, world!")
</pre></code>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<div class="alert alert-warning">1. For some unknown reason "proc" can be used to declare a block of code that returns a result. Best practice is to use "func" to create.</div>
