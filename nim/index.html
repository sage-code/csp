<h2>Nim Tutorial</h2>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
Nim is a statically typed system programming language that is focusing on safety and performance.  It’s a third generation language with features inspired from a high-level languages:  Python, Ada and Lisp. It was created by a team lead by Andreas Rumpf from Germany and is now ready for production projects.

<h2>Video Lecture</h2>

<p>If you have the bandwidth, you can watch the next video for an interview with Nim author. This film is 17 minutes long, it has no ads and is very informative for beginners. He is revealing his vision and justify the way Nim was implemented.

<h2>Nim features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Nim can be compiled to C, C++, and even JavaScript;</li>
<li>Nim has macros. It’s very useful for machine learning;</li>
<li>It has generics, templates, and the macros;</li>
<li>Nim has strong data types, verified at compilation;</li>
<li>It is also multi-paradigm: OOP, Functional and Imperative;</li>
<li>Nim has a foreign function interface (FFI);</li>
<li>Nim has a garbage collector, </li>
<li>Provides smooth async support that comes built-in;</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's wrong?</h2>

<p>Nim has potential but is not a popular language. Is something wrong? My oppinion is that Nin has design issues that hold developers back. First of all the author do not work full time to this language. These are some other issues I have read from internet about Nim</p>

<ul>
<li>People say the community is not active;</li>
<li>People say that it has many bugs;</li>
<li>People say there are no jobs for Nim;</li>
</ul>

<h2>I don't like!</h2>

<p>I don't know the language yet, I study and take notes but I have found from start things that I don't like and demotivate my study. However I want to learn this language, eventual I can contribute to improve it. So this is a hobby project actually.</p>

<ul>
<li>Not having end of block is bad idea;</li>
<li>Compilation to C/C++ makes no sens for a system language;</li>
<li>Compilation to JavaScript is unnecessary for a system language;</li>
</ul>
