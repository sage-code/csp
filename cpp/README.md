## Contribution

This is a beginner friendly project good for students to gain experience when study C++ for school. You can study and contribute to this project on your spare time. The project is supervised by a mentor. We use Discussions to enhance the tutorial. Anybody can report errors and make sugestions for improvements.

The course is used as reference for making courses on-line on Twitch. We maintain slides in parallel. You must be member on Discord and you need to have @instructor role. This is granted to developers who prove to know C++ already. Beginners can learn from this tutorial and take a quiz.

**Acceptance**

Students who can pass the existing quiz will be invited to contribute to improve demo code, articles and slides. We believe the most efficient method to learn is by teaching. Therefore we enable everyone willing to contribute a chanse. You can clone this repository, make changes, preview the changes and make a PR (Pull Request). An instructor will merge your modifications into main branch.

**Direct push**

If you are Sage-Code developer or instructor you can push changes directly. No need for PR. That is a greater responsability. If you have one of these roles and write rights you must make a branch for developement. An instructor will merge your branch at your request into the main branch. Do not work directly into the main branch to avoid conflicts.

## Work Items

We communocate using work items in public, since this is an open source project. Some discutions can lead to work items. So first we discuss then we create work items for strategic changes and enhancements. Typos and small changes can be recorded directly as work items. It is recommanded to document all changes using discutions or work items.

We look forward for you to join our team. Visit our homepage and get an invitation.

Have fun. Work smarter not harder!
