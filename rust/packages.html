<h2>Rust Packages</h2>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
In Rust, a package is a collection of crates, which can either be binary or library crates. A package is defined in the Cargo.toml file and contains metadata about the project, such as its name, version, author, and dependencies. 
</div>


<p>Rust packages can be used for a variety of things, including creating libraries, command-line tools, and web applications. Because Rust is a low-level language that provides high-level abstractions, it's an excellent language for creating efficient and safe systems-based software.</p>

<h2><a id="crates"></a>Crates</h2>

<p>In Rust, a crate is a compilation unit that groups related functionality together. A crate can either be a library crate, which provides APIs that other programs can use, or a binary crate, which is an executable that can be run on its own.</p>

<p>To create a new crate in Rust, you can use the cargo utility, which is the Rust package manager. Here are the steps to create a new library crate:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open your terminal</li>
  <li>Navigate to the directory where you want to create the crate</li>
  <li>Run the following command: <code>cargo new my_crate --lib</code></li>
  <li>This will create a new directory called "my_crate" with a basic Rust library crate structure, including the <code>src/lib.rs</code> file, which is where you can write your library code.</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, if you want to create a binary crate, use the <code>--bin</code> flag instead of <code>--lib</code>, such as <code>cargo new my_crate --bin</code>.</p>

<p>Once you have created your crate, you can add dependencies in the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file and use the <code>cargo build</code> and <code>cargo run</code> commands to build and run your crate, respectively.</p>

<h2><a id="package"></a>Create Package</h2>

<p>In Rust, a package is a collection of crates that are used together. A package can contain one or more library crates and/or binary crates. Here are the basic steps to create a Rust package:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create the package.</li>
  <li>Run the following command: <code>cargo new my_package</code></li>
  <li>In the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file, add any dependencies you need, using the standard TOML format.</li>
  <li>If you want to create a library crate, add a new file in the <code>src/</code> directory with the extension <code>.rs</code>.</li>
  <li>If you want to create a binary crate, add a new file in the <code>src/</code> directory with the extension <code>.rs</code>.</li>
  <li>To build and run your package, you can use the following commands:
  <ul>
    <li><code>cargo build</code> - This will build all of the crates in the package.</li>
    <li><code>cargo run --bin my_binary</code> - This will run the specified binary crate.</li>
    <li><code>cargo test</code> - This will run any tests in the package.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ol>

<p>That's it! You now know how to create a package in Rust.</p>

<h2><a id="library"></a>Rust Libraries</h2>

<p>In Rust, a library refers to a compiled binary file that can be linked to a program. Libraries provide reusable code that can be shared across multiple projects, facilitating code organization and enhancing modularity. They also help avoid writing the same code repeatedly when building different projects.</p>

<p>Rust libraries are created using the <code>cargo</code> command-line tool, which generates a <code>Cargo.toml</code> manifest file for the library. The manifest file defines the library's name, version, and dependencies.</p>

<p>Once a Rust library is built and published, it can be included in other projects by adding it to their dependencies list in their own <code>Cargo.toml</code> file. Then, the library can be used in the project's source code by importing the relevant modules and functions.</p>

<p>Rust provides a package manager called <code>cargo</code> that simplifies the installation, configuration, and management of these libraries.</p>

<h2><a id="builtin"></a>Built-in Packages</h2>

<p>Built-in packages are pre-installed with the Rust installation and provide core functionality of the language. These packages are commonly referred to as "crates" and come bundled with the Rust toolchain.</p>

<p>Some of the most commonly used built-in packages in Rust include:</p>

      <td>A library that provides a flexible logging infrastructure for Rust applications.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://docs.rs/rand"><code>rand</code></a></td>
      <td>A library that provides random number generation functionality.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://docs.rs/sync"><code>sync</code></a></td>
      <td>A library that provides synchronization primitives, such as mutexes and semaphores, for Rust applications.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In conclusion, Rust libraries and built-in packages help developers reuse code and build efficient applications with ease. Rust libraries are created by developers and can be easily shared, while built-in packages are pre-installed and provide core functionality of the language.</p>
