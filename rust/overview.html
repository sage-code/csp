<h2>Rust Overview</h2>


<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
Before you learn the syntax, take a moment to reflect on Rust's capabilities. We'll analyze its main features, strengths, and weaknesses, as well as its performance and productivity.
</div>

<p>Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. It is a perfect choice for developing performance-critical applications.</p>

<h3>Rust's strengths</h3>

<ul>
<li>Performance: Rust is one of the fastest programming languages available. It is comparable to C++ in terms of speed, and it can even outperform C++ in some cases.</li>
<li>Safety: Rust is a memory-safe language, which means that it prevents segfaults and other memory errors. This makes it a good choice for developing high-reliability applications.</li>
<li>Concurrency: Rust is a concurrent language, which means that it can easily handle multiple threads of execution. This makes it a good choice for developing applications that need to handle a lot of data or that need to be responsive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rust's weaknesses</h3>

<ul>
<li>Learning curve: Rust is a complex language, and it can be difficult to learn. However, there are many resources available to help you learn Rust, and the community is very helpful.</li>
<li>Tooling: Rust is a relatively new language, and the tooling is not as mature as some other languages. However, the tooling is improving all the time.</li>
<li>Libraries: Rust has a smaller library ecosystem than some other languages. However, the library ecosystem is growing all the time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Competition</h2>

<p>Here is the list of Rust strength and wekneses compared to alternative system languages. We have included only languages that we teach. This table will help you decide to learn Rust or other language.</p>
