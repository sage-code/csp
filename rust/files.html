<h1>Rust File IO</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
In computing, a file is a structured or unstructured collection of data that is stored on a filesystem or in memory. Files can be used to persist data between different runs of a program, or to communicate data between different programs. 
</div>

<h2><a id="fsmod"></a>FS Module</h2>

<p>In Rust, files are handled using the "std::fs" module, which provides functions for reading from and writing to files, as well as querying metadata such as file size and permissions. </p>

<h4>Example</h4>

Here's a quick example of how to write some data to a file in Rust:

<pre><code class="language-rust line-numbers">
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::prelude::*;

fn main() -&gt; std::io::Result&lt;()&gt; {
    let mut file = File::create("output.txt")?;
    file.write_all(b"Hello, world!")?;
    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>

<p>This program creates a new file called "output.txt" and writes the string "Hello, world!" to it using the "write_all()" method. Note that the "File::create()" method returns a "Result&lt;File, std::io::Error&gt;", which we can handle using Rust's built-in error handling facilities. 
</p>

<p>Reading data from a file is also straightforward, thanks to Rust's "io::BufReader" and "io::Read" traits. Here's an example that reads the contents of a file into a "String":</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust line-numbers">
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{BufReader, prelude::*};

fn main() -&gt; std::io::Result&lt;()&gt; {
    let file = File::open("input.txt")?;
    let reader = BufReader::new(file);

    let mut contents = String::new();
    reader.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;

    println!("{}", contents);
    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>

<p>This program opens a file called "input.txt" and reads its contents into a "String" using the "read_to_string()" method. The "BufReader" is used to read the data in chunks, which can improve performance when reading large files.</p>

<h2><a id="organize"></a>Organize data</h2>

<p>You can organize data using a database or using independent files. The choice between using files or databases to store data depends on the specific application requirements, the amount and complexity of the data, and the resources available for development and maintenance.</p>

<h3>Using databases</h3>

<p>Databases can offer more advanced features, such as querying, indexing, and data integrity checks, which can be especially useful for larger or more complex data sets.</p>

<h3>Using files</h3>

<p>Using files to store data can have some advantages over using a database, such as being lightweight and easy to set up, not requiring a separate server process, and providing more control over the data structure and file format.</p>

<p><b>Note: </b>Storing data in files can be a simple and effective way to organize data, especially for small-scale applications or data sets. There are different file formats that can be used to store data, such as CSV, XML, JSON, or even custom formats.</p>


<h2><a id="access"></a>Access methods</h2>

<p>In Rust, there are a few different ways to access files:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>"File":</em> A simple wrapper around a file handle that allows you to perform basic read and write operations. This is the most straightforward way to work with files in Rust.</li>
<li><em>"BufReader"</em> and "BufWriter": These are buffered wrappers around a "File" (or any other type that implements the "Read" or "Write" traits). They can improve performance by reducing the number of system calls made when reading or writing data.</li>
<li><em>"Path" </em>and <em>"PathBuf"</em>: These are types that represent paths to files or directories. They provide a way to work with file paths in a platform-independent manner.</li>
</ul>

<h3>std::fs::File</h3>

<p>This provides a simple way to open a file and read its contents using Rust's built-in I/O functionality. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{BufRead, BufReader};

fn main() {
    let file = File::open("file.txt").unwrap();
    let reader = BufReader::new(file);

    for line in reader.lines() {
        println!("{}", line.unwrap());
    }
}</code></pre>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Simple and easy to use.</li>
    <li>Provides basic read and write operations.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Unbuffered, so it may not perform as well as other methods.</li>
</ul>

<h3>std::fs::read</h3>

<p>This is a function that reads the contents of a file directly into a byte array. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::fs;

fn main() {
    let contents = fs::read("file.txt").unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", contents);
}</code></pre>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Fast and efficient for reading binary files.</li>
    <li>Provides low-level access to the file system.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Not as flexible as other methods.</li>
    <li>Cannot be used to read large files due to memory constraints.</li>
</ul>

<h3>std::io::BufReader</h3>

<p>This is a buffered reader that reads a file line by line, which can help improve performance by reducing the number of system calls made when reading data. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{BufRead, BufReader};

fn main() {
    let file = File::open("file.txt").unwrap();
    let reader = BufReader::new(file);

    for line in reader.lines() {
        println!("{}", line.unwrap());
    }
}</code></pre>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Buffered, so it can improve performance by reducing the number of system calls made when reading data.</li>
    <li>Provides a convenient way to read data line-by-line.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Not as flexible as other methods.</li>
</ul>

<h3>std::io::Read</h3>

<p>This is a trait that provides basic read functionality, and can be implemented by any type that can be read from (e.g. a file, a network socket, etc.). Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Read;

fn main() {
    let mut file = File::open("file.txt").unwrap();
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&amp;mut contents).unwrap();
    println!("{}", contents);
}</code></pre>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Can be used to read from any type that implements the <code>Read</code> trait.</li>
    <li>Provides low-level access to the file system.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Unbuffered, so it may not perform as well as other methods.</li>
    <li>Not as convenient as methods that provide higher-level abstractions.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, the choice of file access method depends on factors such as performance requirements, the size and complexity of the data being read or written, and the specific use case of the application. In many cases, a combination of these methods may provide the best balance of performance and flexibility.</p>

<h2><a id="json"></a>JSON Files</h2>

<p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML.</p>

<!-- JSON Syntax -->
<h3>JSON Syntax</h3>
<p>A JSON file is a collection of key-value pairs, separated by commas and enclosed in curly braces {}. Keys must be strings, while values can be strings, numbers, nested objects, or arrays. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code class="json">
{
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "address": {
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "Anytown",
      "state": "CA",
      "zip": "12345"
    },
    "phone": [
      {
        "type": "home",
        "number": "555-555-5555"
      },
      {
        "type": "work",
        "number": "555-555-1234"
      }
    ]
}
</code></pre>

<!-- Reading and Writing JSON files in Rust -->
<h2>JSON in Rust</h2>

<!-- Dependency usage -->
<p>Adding Serde and Serde JSON to Cargo.toml</p>

<pre>
  [dependencies]
  serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
  serde_json = "1.0"
</pre>

<!-- Rust examples -->
<h4>Examples</h4>

<p>To read and write data from/to a JSON file in Rust, there are several ways to achieve this, but the most common one is by using serde, a Rust crate for creating and parsing data formats.</p>

<p>Here's an example Rust code that demonstrates how to read and write data to a JSON file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust line-numbers">
// Importing necessary modules
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::prelude::*;

// Define structs to serialize
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
struct Person {
  name: String,
  age: i32,
  address: Address
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
struct Address {
  street: String,
  city: String,
  state: String,
  zip: String
}

fn main() -&gt; std::io::Result&lt;()&gt; {
  // Create a Person object
  let person = Person {
      name: String::from("John"),
      age: 30,
      address: Address {
          street: String::from("123 Main St"),
          city: String::from("Anytown"),
          state: String::from("CA"),
          zip: String::from("12345")
      }
  };

  // Convert Person object to JSON string
  let serialized_person = serde_json::to_string(&person).unwrap();

  // Write JSON string to file
  let mut file = File::create("person.json")?;
  file.write_all(serialized_person.as_bytes())?;

  // Read JSON file
  let file = File::open("person.json")?;
  let mut contents = String::new();
  file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;

  // Convert JSON string to Person object
  let deserialized_person: Person = serde_json::from_str(&contents).unwrap();

  // Print Person object
  println!("{:?}", deserialized_person);

  Ok(())
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this code, we have defined two Rust structs - <code>Person</code> and <code>Address</code> - that represent a person and their address. The <code>#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]</code> macro on top of each struct tells serde to generate code for serializing and deserializing the structs to and from JSON.</p>

<p>We then create a <code>Person</code> object and convert it to a JSON string using <code>serde_json::to_string()</code>. We then write the JSON string to a file using Rust's standard <code>File</code> and <code>Write</code> APIs.</p>

<p>To read the JSON string back from a file, we use the <code>File</code> and <code>Read</code> APIs to open the file and read its contents into a string. We then use <code>serde_json::from_str()</code> to deserialize the string back into a <code>Person</code> object.</p>

<p>Finally, we print the <code>Person</code> object to the console using Rust's standard <code>println!()</code> macro. The output in the console should be:</p>
<pre>
Person { 
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    address: Address { 
      street: "123 Main St",
      city: "Anytown",
      state: "CA",
      zip: "12345"
    }
}
</pre>

<h3>Advantages of JSON:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>JSON provides a more flexible and dynamic data structure, as fields can be added, removed or modified without changing the overall format of the file.</li>
  <li>It can represent nested and hierarchical data structures more effectively, making it suitable for complex data schemas.</li>
  <li>It has built-in support for serializing and deserializing data to and from various programming languages, making it interoperable and easy to work with.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages of JSON:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>JSON can be slower to read and write than fixed-size records because it requires parsing the entire file to access individual fields or records.</li>
  <li>It may require more storage space or bandwidth due to the use of delimiters and metadata.</li>
  <li>JSON can be more difficult to work with in languages that do not have built-in support for parsing or generating JSON.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a id="fixed"></a>Fixed Records</h2>

<div class="alert alert-secondary">Organizing Data in Rust with Structured Files using Fixed-Size Records</div>

<!-- Introduction -->
<p>Fixed-sized record organization is a common way of organizing data in structured files. In Rust, we can define our own data structures with fixed-length fields, and then use these structures to read from and write to files on disk. In this example, we'll define an employee record with the following fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ID: 4 bytes</li>
  <li>Name: 30 bytes</li>
  <li>Age: 2 bytes</li>
  <li>Salary: 4 bytes</li>
</ul>

<!-- CRUD Operations -->
<h2>CRUD Operations</h2>
<p>We'll now demonstrate how to create, read, update, and delete an employee record from a file using fixed-size records. For this example, we'll assume that the file is sorted by employee ID.</p>

<h3>Create a New Record</h3>
<p>To create a new record, we'll open the file in append mode, add the new record to the end of the file, and then close the file. Here's an example code in Rust:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust line-numbers">
use std::io::{Seek, SeekFrom, Write};
use std::fs::OpenOptions;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Employee {
  id: u32,
  name: String,
  age: u16,
  salary: f32,
}

fn main() -&gt; std::io::Result&lt;()&gt; {
  let employee = Employee {
      id: 100,
      name: String::from("Jane Doe"),
      age: 27,
      salary: 50000.0,
  };
  let mut file = OpenOptions::new()
      .append(true)
      .create(true)
      .open("employees.dat")?;
  file.write_all(&employee.id.to_ne_bytes())?;
  file.write_all(employee.name.as_bytes())?;
  file.write_all(&employee.age.to_ne_bytes())?;
  file.write_all(&employee.salary.to_ne_bytes())?;
  Ok(())
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Read a Record</h3>

<p>To read a record, we'll open the file in read mode, seek to the position of the record in the file, and then read the fixed-size record into our data structure. Here's an example code in Rust:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust line-numbers">
fn read_record(file: &mut std::fs::File, id: u32) -&gt; std::io::Result&lt;Employee&gt; {
  let mut buffer = [0_u8; 40];
  file.seek(SeekFrom::Start((id - 1) as u64 * 40))?;
  file.read_exact(&mut buffer)?;
  let name_end = buffer
      .iter()
      .position(|&x| x == 0)
      .unwrap_or(buffer.len());
  let employee = Employee {
      id: u32::from_ne_bytes([buffer[0], buffer[1], buffer[2], buffer[3]]),
      name: String::from_utf8_lossy(&buffer[4..name_end]).trim().to_string(),
      age: u16::from_ne_bytes([buffer[34], buffer[35]]),
      salary: f32::from_ne_bytes([
          buffer[36], buffer[37], buffer[38], buffer[39],
      ]),
  };
  Ok(employee)
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Update a Record</h3>
<p>To update a record, we'll open the file in read-write mode, seek to the position of the record in the file, and then write the updated record back. Here's an example code in Rust:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust line-numbers">
fn update_record(file: &mut std::fs::File, id: u32, employee: &Employee) -&gt; std::io::Result&lt;()&gt; {
  file.seek(SeekFrom::Start((id - 1) as u64 * 40))?;
  file.write_all(&employee.id.to_ne_bytes())?;
  let mut name_bytes = vec![0_u8; 30];
  name_bytes[..employee.name.len()].copy_from_slice(employee.name.as_bytes());
  file.write_all(&name_bytes)?;
  file.write_all(&employee.age.to_ne_bytes())?;
  file.write_all(&employee.salary.to_ne_bytes())?;
  Ok(())
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Delete a Record</h3>
<p>To delete a record, we'll open the file in read-write mode, move all the records after it one position back in the file, and then truncate the file to remove the last record. Here's an example code in Rust:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust line-numbers">
fn delete_record(file: &mut std::fs::File, id: u32, total_records: u32) -&gt; std::io::Result&lt;()&gt; {
  let last_id = total_records;
  let mut buffer = vec![0_u8; 40];
  for i in id..last_id {
      file.seek(SeekFrom::Start((i as u64) * 40))?;
      file.read_exact(&mut buffer)?;
      file.seek(SeekFrom::Start(((i - 1) as u64) * 40))?;
      file.write_all(&buffer)?;
  }
  file.set_len(((last_id - 1) * 40) as u64)?;
  Ok(())
}
</code></pre>

<!-- Advantages -->
<h3>Advantages of Fixed-Size Records</h3>
<p>Fixed-size records have several advantages over variable-length records. It's worth noting the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Random access:</strong> Each record can be accessed directly by its position in the file, without having to scan the entire file. This makes retrieval of specific records very efficient.</li>
  <li><strong>Indexed access:</strong> The fixed size of the records makes it easy to build indices that can be used to quickly locate records that match certain criteria.</li>
  <li><strong>Efficient storage:</strong> Since each record has a fixed size, the file can be pre-allocated to a fixed size, reducing fragmentation and improving storage efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages of fixed-size records:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed-size records provide a fixed layout for the data, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of data, which can lead to better performance in terms of read and write operations.</li>
  <li>They enable random access to individual records based on their position in the file, allowing fast retrieval of specific records without having to parse the entire file.</li>
  <li>Fixed-size records also make it easy to build indices that can be used to quickly locate records that match specific criteria.</li>
  <li>Since each record has a fixed size, the file can be pre-allocated to a fixed size, reducing fragmentation and improving storage efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages of fixed-size records:</h3>

<p>When you organize data you have these two popular choices. If you don't use a database, you can yet store your data in files.

<ul>
  <li>Fixed-size records require all fields to have the same size, which can result in wasted space for fields with smaller data types or cause issues when a field's maximum size is exceeded.</li>
  <li>Adding or removing fields from the data schema requires modifying the code that reads and writes to the file, which can lead to maintenance issues.</li>
  <li>They are not well-suited for hierarchical or nested data structures that are better represented with other formats like JSON or XML.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>In conclusion, both fixed-size records and JSON have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific data requirements and use cases of a project. Fixed-size records are well-suited for data with a defined and unchanging schema, while JSON is more flexible and versatile. It ultimately comes down to the trade-off between performance and flexibility.</p>
